# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 30, 2018

I am no stranger to coding or programming. I even have a CS degree. I have been coding for more than 10 years. However, I had never had the chance to dive deep into one specific language; javascript.

And that's the only language I really want to be good at.

I am no stranger to coding in javascript either. I have taken the javascript course from Codeacademy, played around with it and have even written plenty of code in jQuery.

However, I don't know how to select an element with vanilla javascript. Or how closures work and why are they so useful. Or why scope is so tricky. And don't even get me started with `this`.

So I figured out that #100DaysOfCode would provide me the two things that kept me from seriously learning javascript; **consistency** and **accountability**.

### Day 1: October 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started the book Javascript: the good parts. Finished the Objects chapter.

**Thoughts:** I think this book will provide me a solid refresher about javascript and its core concepts.

### Day 2: October 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Halfway through the Functions chapter of 'Javascript: The Good Parts'. 

**Thoughts:** I always try the code and then play around with it. I'm trying to spend as much time on the editor as possible.

### Day 3: October 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through functions invocation and scope.

**Thoughts:** Could have gone through more, but I ran out of time. Under other circumstances, maybe I would quit again. But no, not this time. 

### Day 4: October 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Almost finished with the functions chapter. I will leave Memoization.

**Thoughts:** Invaluable info about closures and modules. I am starting to get a better grasp on them. Also, muscle memory has started to take affect as I practice more and more on the editor.

### Day 5: October 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Read about memoization and inheritance.

**Thoughts:** The chapter about inheritance provided a solid theoritical base. I suppose the topic will make better sense once I start writing code for practical examples.
